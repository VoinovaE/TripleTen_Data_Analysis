### Project Description

You work as a video ad analyst at the advertising agency.<br> 
You devote a lot of time to analyzing trending videos on YouTube to determine what content deserves marketing attention.<br>
Each video has a specific category (Entertainment, Music, News & Politics, etc.), region, and trending date. A video can be in the trending section for several days in a row.<br> 

Business goal: analyze trending-video history on YouTube<br>
Dashboard data content:
* Trending videos from the past, broken down by day and category
* Trending videos, broken down by countries
* A table of correspondence between categories and countries

Parameters according to which the data is to be grouped:
* Trending date and time
* Video category
* Country

The data:
* Trending history — absolute values with a breakdown by day (two graphs: absolute numbers and percentage ratio)
* Events, broken down by countries — relative values (% of events)
* The correspondence between the categories and countries — absolute values (a table)

The dashboard is used to answer the questions:
* Which video categories trended most often?
* How were they distributed among regions?
* What categories were especially popular in the United States? Were there any differences between the categories popular in the US and those popular elsewhere?
